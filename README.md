Note: This one was submitted late because I had asked for an extenstion to I could study for my MCAT. I also had another proj 5 repository, but I deleted it and restarted since I couldn't get it to work consistantly. 

This is my first attempt at an android app, so its going to be relatively simple compared to my last IOS app. I'm going to create a game that helps pre-medical students study for their MCAT by memorizing their Amino Acids. It should be simple to implement, but learning how to use android studio may be difficult.

I used android because the hard drive on my mac failed and I couldn't really get my hands on another one for project 5. Oh well, at least I learned some android dev.
