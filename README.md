Note: I had another proj 5 repository, but i deleted it and restarted since I couldn't get it to work consistantly. 

This is my first attempt at an android app, so its going to be relatively simple compared to my last IOS app. I'm going to create a game that helps pre-medical students help study for their MCAT by memorizing their Amino Acids. It should be simple to implement, but learning how to use android studio may be difficult.
